# Multi-dimensional Search
This contains a class programming assignment which uses hash tables and binary trees to optimally organize an "inventory" for searching

P3Driver.java was provided as a driver to test the project file.

MDS.java was initialized with only the required method names and signatures.

I am responsible for writing the Item subclass, all class members, and all method bodies in MDS.java.
